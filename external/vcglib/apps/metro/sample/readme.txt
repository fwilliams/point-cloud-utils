This directory contains four 3d models that can be used to test metro. The models represent the same toroidal knot at two different level of details.

- knot_orig.ply           12800 vertexes, 25600 triangles: the original high resolution mesh
- knot_subsampled.ply       800 vertexes,  1600 triangles: a low res model obtained by simple uniform subsampling
- knot_vcg_simplified.ply   800 vertexes,  1600 triangles: a low res model obtained by our library simplification code
- knot_max_simplified.stl   800 vertexes,  1600 triangles: a low res model obtained by using a commercial tool
